<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is a self-documenting example app useful for quick developer and/or learning backbone.js.</p>
<p>There are many boiler plates for Backbone.js boilerplates popping up over the place with different philosophies. 
This solution aims to be absolutely light-weight and robust keeping the following points in mind;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand on the shoulders of giants (Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Require.js, Html5Boilerplate) </li>
  <li>Perpetuate great and efficient practices for single page applications</li>
  <li>Optimized deployment consisting of one js file, one image sprite and one css file (with exceptions)</li>
  <li>One command optimization</li>
  <li>No enforced pre-compilation creating a low entry barrier to starting</li>
  <li>Modular environment (reusable, isolated testing)</li>
  <li>Speed!</li>
</ul>
<p>The project aims at being a modular backbone environment with as little authority on development as possible such that developers can innovate and contribute in an attempt to mimic the success of backbone.js ambiguous nature.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>Simply clone the repo and serve the files on a http server (nginx, apache)</p>
<code>git clone https://github.com/thomasdavis/backboneboilerplate.git</code>
<p>Alternatively, if you have nodejs installed, you may run <code>build/server</code></p>
